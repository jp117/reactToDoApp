# reactToDoApp

### To Do List

-   ~~make input, header, tasks and task components~~
-   ~~Add input form~~
-   ~~Add State to add new tasks~~
-   ~~Add JSON server or DB functionality (used JSON server for development)~~
-   ~~Add delete functionality (update state so no refresh but send DELETE to db)~~
-   Style, maybe?
-   Sockets maybe, so I can update the state of tasks when someone else enters a task into DB?
